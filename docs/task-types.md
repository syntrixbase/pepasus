# Task Types (Subagent Specialization)

> Source code: `src/subagents/`, `subagents/*/SUBAGENT.md`

## Core Idea

Not every background task needs the same tools or instructions. A web search should not have write_file. A planning task should not be calling web_search. Task Types let the MainAgent spawn **specialized subagents** with per-type tool sets and system prompts.

Subagent types are defined as **files** (SUBAGENT.md), not hardcoded. Users can add custom subagent types by creating files in `data/subagents/`.

## File Format

Each subagent type is a directory containing `SUBAGENT.md` with YAML frontmatter + markdown body:

```
subagents/
  general/SUBAGENT.md    # builtin, git tracked
  explore/SUBAGENT.md
  plan/SUBAGENT.md
data/subagents/           # user-created, runtime (overrides builtin)
  deepresearch/SUBAGENT.md
```

```yaml
---
name: explore
description: "Fast, read-only research agent. Use when you need to search, read, or gather information."
tools: "read_file, list_files, http_get, web_search, notify, ..."
model: fast              # optional: tier name or "provider/model"
---

## Your Role
You are a research assistant...

## Rules
1. READ ONLY: ...
```

Frontmatter fields:
- `name`: subagent type name (must match directory name)
- `description`: injected into MainAgent system prompt to help LLM choose the right type
- `tools`: comma-separated tool names, or `"*"` for all task tools
- `model`: _(optional)_ tier name (`fast`, `balanced`, `powerful`) or direct model spec (`openai/gpt-4o`). Resolved via `ModelRegistry.resolve()`. If omitted, the subagent uses the Agent's default model.

Body: the system prompt appended to the base persona prompt when this subagent type runs.

## Why

Today, every spawned task gets the full `allTaskTools` array (26+ tools) and a generic "background task worker" system prompt. This causes problems:

1. **Tool overload**: LLM sees 26 tools and sometimes picks wrong ones (e.g., writing files when asked to "explore" a topic)
2. **No specialization**: The system prompt says "you are a background task worker" for every task, no matter the intent
3. **Safety gap**: An "explore" task has write_file/delete_file — unnecessary risk
4. **Skill integration gap**: `SkillDefinition.agent` field exists but is unused — designed for routing skills to specific task types

## Task Types

| Type | Purpose | Tools | System Prompt Focus |
|------|---------|-------|---------------------|
| `general` | Default, full capabilities | All task tools | Current "background task worker" prompt |
| `explore` | Read-only research, web search, information gathering | Read-only subset | "Gather information, summarize findings, do NOT modify anything" |
| `plan` | Analyze and produce a written plan | Read-only + write to memory | "Analyze the problem, produce a structured plan" |

### Tool Sets

**general** (default — all task tools, unchanged):
- system: current_time, sleep, get_env, set_env
- file: read_file, write_file, list_files, delete_file, move_file, get_file_info, edit_file, grep_files
- network: http_get, http_post, http_request, web_search
- data: json_parse, json_stringify, base64_encode, base64_decode
- memory: memory_list, memory_read, memory_write, memory_patch, memory_append
- task: task_list, task_replay
- notify

**explore** (read-only — no write, no mutation):
- system: current_time, get_env
- file: read_file, list_files, get_file_info, grep_files
- network: http_get, web_search
- data: json_parse, base64_decode
- memory: memory_list, memory_read
- task: task_list, task_replay
- notify

**plan** (read-only + write to memory):
- system: current_time, get_env
- file: read_file, list_files, get_file_info, grep_files
- network: http_get, web_search
- data: json_parse, base64_decode
- memory: memory_list, memory_read, memory_write, memory_append
- task: task_list, task_replay
- notify

> **Note on http_request**: Excluded from explore and plan because it supports arbitrary HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE), which violates the read-only contract. Only `http_get` and `web_search` are included.

### System Prompts

Each task type gets a specialized system prompt section. The `buildSystemPrompt` function takes a `taskType` parameter (orthogonal to cognitive stage) to select the appropriate instructions.

**general** (existing prompt — unchanged):
```
## Your Role
You are a background task worker. Your results will be returned to a main agent...

## Rules
1. FOCUS: Stay strictly on the task...
2. CONCISE RESULT: Synthesize... keep under 2000 chars.
3. EFFICIENT: Use the minimum number of tool calls...
4. If a tool call fails, note briefly and move on.
5. NOTIFY: Use notify() for major milestones...
```

**explore**:
```
## Your Role
You are a research assistant. Your job is to gather information, search, read, and analyze.
Your results will be returned to a main agent. You do NOT interact with the user directly.

## Rules
1. READ ONLY: You must NOT create, modify, or delete any files. You are here to observe and report.
2. FOCUS: Stay strictly on the research question. Do not explore tangential topics.
3. CONCISE RESULT: Synthesize findings into a clear, concise summary (under 2000 chars).
4. EFFICIENT: Use the minimum number of tool calls. Don't over-research.
5. If a tool call fails, note briefly and move on.
6. NOTIFY: Use notify() for progress updates on long searches.
```

**plan**:
```
## Your Role
You are a planning assistant. Your job is to analyze problems and produce structured plans.
Your results will be returned to a main agent. You do NOT interact with the user directly.

## Rules
1. ANALYSIS FIRST: Read and understand the relevant code/data before proposing anything.
2. STRUCTURED OUTPUT: Present your plan with clear steps, each with specific actions and rationale.
3. READ ONLY (mostly): You may read files and search the web, but do NOT modify code files.
   You may write to memory (memory_write/memory_append) to persist your plan.
4. CONCISE RESULT: Keep your final plan under 2000 characters.
5. EFFICIENT: Use the minimum number of tool calls needed.
6. If a tool call fails, note briefly and move on.
7. NOTIFY: Use notify() for progress updates.
```

## Design Decisions

### 1. `spawn_subagent` gets a `type` parameter

MainAgent's LLM uses `spawn_subagent(type, description, input)` to specify the task type. The type defaults to `"general"` for backward compatibility.

The MainAgent system prompt explains when to use each type:
```
- spawn_subagent(type: "explore"): research, web search, code reading, information gathering (read-only)
- spawn_subagent(type: "plan"): analyze a problem, produce a structured plan (read + write plans)
- spawn_subagent(type: "general"): full capabilities — file I/O, code changes, multi-step work
```

### 2. Type stored in TaskContext, flows through events

`TaskContext` gets a `taskType` field. The type flows:
- `spawn_subagent(type)` → `Agent.submit(text, source, type)` → `MESSAGE_RECEIVED` event payload → `TaskFSM.fromEvent()` → `context.taskType`
- Agent reads `context.taskType` to select tools and system prompt at each cognitive iteration

On resume, `taskType` is preserved (not cleared by `prepareContextForResume`).

### 3. Tool restriction is two-layer defense

**LLM visibility layer** (primary): The per-type ToolRegistry determines which tools the LLM sees in its function calling schema. If the LLM never sees `write_file`, it cannot generate a `write_file` tool call.

**Execution layer** (safety net): Before executing a tool call in `_runAct`, Agent validates the tool name against the task's type-specific allowed tool list. A disallowed tool call returns an error result (not an exception) — this guards against prompt injection or LLM hallucination.

### 4. `buildSystemPrompt` parameter separation

The current `stage` parameter in `buildSystemPrompt(persona, stage)` refers to the cognitive stage (e.g., `"reason"`). Task type is an orthogonal dimension. The function signature changes to `buildSystemPrompt(persona, { taskType? })` — the existing `"reason"` stage behavior is replaced by `taskType: "general"` (same prompt content, better naming).

### 5. Per-type tool registries in Agent

Agent creates a `Map<TaskType, ToolRegistry>` at construction time. Each key maps to a ToolRegistry populated with the appropriate tool subset. When `_runReason` runs, it selects the registry matching `task.context.taskType` and passes it to `Thinker.run()`.

Thinker's `run()` method accepts an optional `toolRegistry` parameter that overrides the instance default. This keeps Thinker stateless — the same instance serves all task types.

### 6. Skill system integration

`SkillDefinition.agent` maps to `TaskType`. When a fork skill is spawned, its `agent` field determines the task type (defaulting to `"general"`). This connects the existing skill metadata to the new type system.

### 7. Persistence and backward compatibility

`taskType` is stored in the `TASK_CREATED` event data alongside `inputText`, `source`, and `inputMetadata`. On replay, `taskType` is restored. Old JSONL files without `taskType` default to `"general"`.

## Data Flow

```
User: "search for the latest AI papers"
  ↓
MainAgent LLM decides: spawn_subagent(type="explore", input="...")
  ↓
MainAgent extracts type, calls agent.submit(input, source, type="explore")
  ↓
Agent emits MESSAGE_RECEIVED with payload.taskType = "explore"
  ↓
TaskFSM.fromEvent() → context.taskType = "explore"
  ↓
Agent._runReason(task)
  → selects exploreToolRegistry from per-type map
  → builds system prompt with taskType="explore"
  → LLM sees explore-specific tools + explore-specific prompt
  ↓
Task executes with restricted tools and specialized instructions
  ↓
Agent._runAct(task)
  → validates tool calls against explore allowed list
  → executes approved tools, rejects disallowed ones
```

## Future Extensions

- **deepresearch**: Higher iteration limit, larger response budget, multi-source synthesis
- **code**: Code generation/modification specialist, potentially with LSP integration
- **Custom types**: User-defined task types via configuration (tool list + prompt template)
