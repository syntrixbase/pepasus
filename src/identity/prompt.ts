 * Unified prompt builder — compile a Persona into a system prompt for LLM calls.

 * - "main": Full prompt for MainAgent (inner monologue, tools, channels, skills, etc.)
 * - "task": Minimal prompt for Task Agent (identity + safety + subagent instructions)
 *
 * Default mode is "task" for backward compatibility with Thinker callers.
